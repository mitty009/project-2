# Media Database
##### Project Status: Infancy

## Description
This application is a service where a user can filter trending, popular, 
top rated or manually searched television and movie information. The primary purpose of
this project was to solidify JavaScript, CSS, REACT and API navigation skills developed during a 
full stack Software Engineering bootcamp by completing the project in a 48hr 'Hackathon'. 

## Usage
Greeted by a split landing page, you are able to to choose to search either 
TV or Movies.
After selection, a simple user interface allows for left clicking any media title displayed to promulgate further information
about the movie or series. 
Filtering content can be completed via a search bar or by using a dropdown element. 
The dropdown will allow filtering by the following:

Movies | TV
----------- | ------------
Trending    | Trending
Popular | Popular
In Cinemas | Airing Today
Top Rated | Top Rated
Coming Soon |

## Future Realeases
Due to the infancy of the project and the speed in which it was created, further functionality 
may be developed to include torrent API fetching, watching content in browser, additional filtering 
options etc. Other ammendments need to be made for mobile responsiveness and series card information
styling.
